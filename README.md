Noob in the truest sense of the word

Hello Everyone, 

I have had a pretty uninteresting ride upto opening an account over her. I am a complete noob to the world of programming/code/web-development but it has always fascinated me in the sense that I believe this is a skill set that is challenging, fun and imperative to have in today's professional landscape. I currently work in the Finance world in the role of a Mutual Fund Portfolio Solutions wholesaler/Financial Advisor Coach. Why I do that and how did I get to that role is probably a story for another day.

Now, I do realize that these are mere assumptions made by someone who is standing on the outside of the programming world dome but I believe the first step is the hardest to take and I am ready to be humbled. I hope this is the start of a meaningful experience for me. 

Excited to hit it off,
sinnermanzero
